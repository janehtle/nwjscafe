Hi friends!

This website is a clone of the website-template page from designmodo. This was "homework" given by my mentor to practice and test my skills of HTML and CSS. 

I had freedom of choice as far as content goes, so my inspiration came from one of my favorite K-POP girl groups, NEWJEANS, and the existence of fancafes or fansites. 

All media used are to be credited towards the original creators, NEWJEANS and the company HYBE. This website is solely for fun and practice and not for any financial gain or misuse. Thanks!
